#### You:
Write me a Typescript function that retrieves German holidays dates for input parameters year and "name of holiday" (in German) from a public holiday google calendar.

#### ChatGPT:
Here is an example of a TypeScript function that retrieves German holiday dates for a given year and holiday name (in German) from a public holiday Google calendar:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';

const calendar = google.calendar('v3');

async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const holidays = await calendar.events.list({
        calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
        timeMin: new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`),
        timeMax: new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`),
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: 'startTime',
    });

    const holidayDates = holidays.data.items
        .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
        .map((holiday) => holiday.start.date);

    return holidayDates;
}
```

This function uses the `googleapis` package to access the Google Calendar API, and the `calendarId` specified is for the German holiday calendar. The function takes in a year and a holiday name (in German) as input parameters, and returns an array of strings representing the dates of the holiday for that year.

Note: Before you can use this function, you must have enabled the Google Calendar API and obtained a valid API key or OAuth 2.0 credentials.

#### You:
can you add the code to authenticate using an api key? You can expect that the API key is available via an environment variable of your choice.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is an example of how you could authenticate using an API key, while assuming the API key is available via an environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY`:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',
    auth: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY
});

async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const holidays = await calendar.events.list({
        calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
        timeMin: new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`),
        timeMax: new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`),
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: 'startTime',
    });

    const holidayDates = holidays.data.items
        .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
        .map((holiday) => holiday.start.date);

    return holidayDates;
}
```

You can pass the API key to the `auth` property of the `calendar` object.

Please note that the code above is just an example and it's important to ensure that the API key is kept secure,
and should not be hardcoded or committed to version control.

#### You:
please use `https://www.abstractapi.com/api/holidays-api` instead

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is an example of how you could use the `https://www.abstractapi.com/api/holidays-api` API to retrieve German holiday dates for a given year and holiday name (in German):

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const holidaysApiUrl = 'https://www.abstractapi.com/api/holidays-api';

async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const holidays = await axios.get(holidaysApiUrl, {
        params: {
            country_code: 'de',
            year: year
        },
        headers: {
            'x-api-key': process.env.ABSTRACT_API_KEY
        }
    });

    const holidayDates = holidays.data.holidays
        .filter((holiday) => holiday.name === holidayName)
        .map((holiday) => holiday.date);

    return holidayDates;
}
```

This function uses the `axios` package to make a GET request to the `https://www.abstractapi.com/api/holidays-api` API. It takes in a year and a holiday name (in German) as input parameters, and returns an array of strings representing the dates of the holiday for that year.

The `params` object passed in the request contains the country code 'de' and the year for which you want to retrieve the holidays.

You must have enabled the API and obtained a valid API key, which is available via an environment variable called `ABSTRACT_API_KEY`.

Please note that the code above is just an example and it's important to ensure that the API key is kept secure and should not be hardcoded or committed to version control.

#### You:
I do like the google api version better, so please add explanatory comments to it and adapt the code so that it is a node.js module with all necessary imports and exports

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is an example of the Google Calendar API version with explanatory comments and adapted to be a Node.js module with all necessary imports and exports:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';

//create an instance of the Calendar API
const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',
    auth: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY
});

// function that retrieves German holiday dates for a given year and holiday name (in German) from a public holiday Google calendar
async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<string[]> {
    // make a GET request to the events.list method of the calendar API
    // to retrieve all events within the specified year
    const holidays = await calendar.events.list({
        calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
        timeMin: new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`),
        timeMax: new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`),
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: 'startTime',
    });

    // filter the holidays by the specified holiday name and map the holiday dates
    const holidayDates = holidays.data.items
        .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
        .map((holiday) => holiday.start.date);

    return holidayDates;
}

export default getHolidayDates;
```

This function uses the `googleapis` package to access the Google Calendar API, and the `calendarId` specified is for the German holiday calendar.
It takes in a year and a holiday name (in German) as input parameters, and returns an array of strings representing the dates of the holiday for that year.

The `calendar` object is created by passing the API key to the `auth` property, which is obtained via an environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

It's important to note that the code above is just an example and it's important to ensure that the API key is kept secure and should not be hardcoded or committed to version control. Also, the `googleapis` package need to be installed to your project

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.

#### You:
The compiler says it cannot find googleapis.

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the confusion, In order to use the `googleapis` package, you will first need to install it in your project.

You can install it by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install googleapis
```

or

```csharp
yarn add googleapis
```

Once it's installed, you should be able to import it in your code and use the `google.calendar` object to interact with the Google Calendar API.

Please also make sure that you have enabled the Google Calendar API for your project and obtained a valid API key or OAuth 2.0 credentials. You will need to pass this API key to the `auth` property when creating the `calendar` object.

Let me know if you have any other issues.

#### You:
The method getHolidayDates should be blocking with a corresponding error handling and return date-fns compatible dates and not strings

#### ChatGPT:
Here is an updated version of the function that handles errors and returns date-fns compatible dates:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',
    auth: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY
});

/**

 */
async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<Date[]> {
    try {
        // make a GET request to the events.list method of the calendar API
        // to retrieve all events within the specified year
        const holidays = await calendar.events.list({

        });

        // filter the holidays by the specified holiday name and map the holiday dates
        const holidayDates = holidays.data.items
            .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
            .map((holiday) => parse(holiday.start.date, "yyyy-MM-dd", new Date()));

        if (holidayDates.length === 0) {
            throw new Error(`Holiday ${holidayName} not found for year ${year}`);
        }
        return holidayDates;
    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
    }
}
export default getHolidayDates;
```

This function uses the `googleapis` package to access the Google Calendar API, and the `calendarId` specified is for the German holiday calendar.
It takes in a year and a holiday name (in German) as input parameters, and returns an array of `Date` objects representing the dates of the holiday for that year.

The `calendar` object is created by passing the API key to the `auth` property, which is obtained via an environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

It uses the `parse` function from date-fns package to convert the string date format returned by the API to a JavaScript Date object, and throws an error in case the API call fails or the holiday is not found.

Please make sure that you have installed the date-fns package and that you have enabled the Google Calendar API for your project and obtained a valid API key or OAuth 2.0 credentials.

Let me know if you have any other issues or if there's anything else I can help you with.

#### You:
The compiler does not accept the line "calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',". It says:  "No overload matches this call.
  Overload 2 of 6, '(callback: BodyResponseCallback<Schema$Events>): void', gave the following error.
    Argument of type '{ calendarId: string; timeMin: Date; timeMax: Date; singleEvents: boolean; orderBy: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'BodyResponseCallback<Schema$Events>'.
      Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'calendarId' does not exist in type 'BodyResponseCallback<Schema$Events>'."

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the mistake, it seems that the error is being caused by the way the `calendar.events.list` method is being invoked.

The `calendar.events.list` method takes in an object with several properties, including the `calendarId` and the `timeMin`, `timeMax`, `singleEvents`, `orderBy` properties that are being passed in the example.

Here is an updated version of the function that should work:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',
    auth: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY
});

/**

 * @throws {Error} if the API call fails or the holiday is not found
 */
async function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<Date[]> {
    try {
        // make a GET request to the events.list method of the calendar API
        // to retrieve all events within the specified year
        const holidays = await calendar.events.list({
            calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
            timeMin: format(new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
            timeMax: format(new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
            singleEvents: true,
            orderBy: 'startTime',
        });
        // filter the holidays by the specified holiday name and map the holiday dates
        const holidayDates = holidays.data.items
            .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
            .map((holiday) => parse(holiday.start.date, "yyyy-MM-dd", new Date()));

        if (holidayDates.length === 0) {
            throw new Error(`Holiday ${holidayName} not found for year ${year}`);
        }
        return holidayDates;
    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
    }
}
export default getHolidayDates;
```

The error was caused because the timeMin and timeMax properties needs to be in the format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX" instead of Date Object, so I've used the date-fns package to format the date accordingly.

Please let me know if this works or if there's anything else I can help you with.

#### You:
The compiler argues "'holidays.data.items' is possibly 'undefined'." and "'holiday.start' is possibly 'undefined'.ts(18048)
Argument of type 'string | null | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2345)"

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the mistake, it seems that the error is being caused because the `items` and `start` properties of the response object may not be defined.

One way to fix this issue is to check if the properties exist before trying to access them. You can use the `if (holidays.data && holidays.data.items)` to check if the items property exists and proceed accordingly.

Here is an updated version of the function that should work:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
}
}
export default getHolidayDates;

```vbnet

In this version of the function, I've added a check to see if the `holidays.data.items` property exists before trying to access it. If it does exist, the function filters the holidays by the specified holiday name, maps the holiday dates and assigns them to the `holidayDates` variable. If the items property is not defined, the holidayDates variable will stay empty.

Also, I've added an additional check to check if the `holidayDates` array is empty, if it is, it throws an error that the holiday was not found for that year.

Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.
```

#### You:
My project uses setting `strict`.

#### ChatGPT:
In strict mode, TypeScript assumes that the properties of an object are `undefined` unless they are explicitly defined with a type.

To fix this issue with the `holidays.data.items` property, you can use the `as` keyword to cast the `holidays.data` object to the expected type.

Here is an updated version of the function that should work with the `strict` setting enabled:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',

In this version of the function, I've defined two interfaces `Holiday` and `Holidays`, to explicitly define the shape of the `holidays.data` object and its properties, `items`. Then using the `as` keyword, I've cast the `holidays.data` object to the `Holidays` type, to ensure that TypeScript knows that the `items` property is expected to exist.

This way, TypeScript will no longer raise an error when trying to access the `items` property.

Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.
```

#### You:
The compiler says "Variable 'holidayDates' implicitly has type 'any[]' in some locations where its type cannot be determined.".

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the mistake, it seems that the error is being caused because the `holidayDates` variable is not being explicitly typed. In strict mode, TypeScript requires that variables are given a type.

In this version of the function, I've explicitly typed the `holidayDates` variable as an array of `Date` objects by adding `: Date[]` after the variable declaration. This way TypeScript will not raise an error and know that `holidayDates` is an array of Dates.

Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.

#### You:
The compiler says "'err' is of type 'unknown'.ts(18046)".

            orderBy: 'startTime',
        });
        let holidayDates: Date[] = []
        if (holidays.data && (holidays.data as Holidays).items) {
            holidayDates = (holidays.data as Holidays).items
                .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
                .map((holiday) => parse(holiday.start.date, "yyyy-MM-dd", new Date()));
        }
        if (holidayDates.length === 0) {
            throw new Error(`Holiday ${holidayName} not found for year ${year}`);
        }
        return holidayDates;
    } catch (err: unknown) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${(err as Error).message}`);
    }
}
export default getHolidayDates;
```

In this version of the function, I've explicitly typed the `err` variable as an instance of the `Error` class by adding `: unknown` after the variable declaration and then on the throw statement, I've casted the `err` variable to the `Error` type using `as Error` . This way TypeScript will not raise an error and know that `err` is an instance of the Error class.

Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.

#### You:
The method still returns a promise although I would like to have a blocking function that returns Date[]

#### ChatGPT:
You're correct, the function is currently returning a promise that resolves to an array of `Date` objects.

To make the function blocking and return the `Date[]` directly, you can use the `await` keyword inside of a `try-catch` block and remove the `async` keyword from the function definition.

Here is the updated version of the function:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',
    auth: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY
});

interface Holiday {
    summary: string;
    start: { date: string }
}

interface Holidays {
    items: Holiday[]
}

/**
 * function that retrieves German holiday dates for a given year and holiday name (in German) from a public holiday Google calendar
 *
 * @param {number} year the year for which you want to retrieve the holidays
 * @param {string} holidayName the name of the holiday in German
 * @return {Date[]} returns an array of dates representing the dates of the holiday for that year
 * @throws {Error} if the API call fails or the holiday is not found
 */
function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Date[] {
    try {
        // make a GET request to the events.list method of the calendar API
        // to retrieve all events within the specified year
        const holidays = calendar.events.list({
            calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
            timeMin: format(new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
            timeMax: format(new Date(`${year}-12-31T
```

#### You:
please continue with the code.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is the rest of the function:

```typescript
23:59:59.999Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
            singleEvents: true,
            orderBy: 'startTime',
        }).then(response => response.data);
        let holidayDates: Date[] = []
        if (holidays.items) {
            holidayDates = holidays.items
                .filter((holiday) => holiday.summary === holidayName)
                .map((holiday) => parse(holiday.start.date, "yyyy-MM-dd", new Date()));
        }
        if (holidayDates.length === 0) {
            throw new Error(`Holiday ${holidayName} not found for year ${year}`);
        }
        return holidayDates;
    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
    }
}
export default getHolidayDates;
```

In this version of the function, I've removed the `async` keyword from the function definition and wrapped the `calendar.events.list` method with `.then(response => response.data)` this way the function will wait for the response from the Google Calendar API before executing the next lines of code and the function will directly return the holidayDates array.

Please let me know if

#### You:
The compiler complains "Property 'items' does not exist on type 'Promise<Schema$Events>'.ts(2339)
holiday.ts(38, 22): Did you forget to use 'await'?".

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the mistake, the error is being caused because TypeScript does not know that the `holidays` variable is going to be resolved to an object with an `items` property because the `calendar.events.list` method is returning a promise.

To fix this issue, you can use the `await` keyword inside of the try block to wait for the promise to resolve before trying to access the `items` property.

Here is the updated version of the function:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { parse, format } from 'date-fns';

const calendar = google.calendar({
    version: 'v3',

 */
function getHolidayDates(year: number, holidayName: string): Date[] {
    try {
        // make a GET request to the events.list method of the calendar API
        // to retrieve all events within the specified year
        const holidays = await calendar.events.list({
            calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
            timeMin: format(new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),

        }
        return holidayDates;
    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday
```

#### You:
please continue with the code.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is the end of the function:

```typescript
dates: ${err.message}`);
    }
}
export default getHolidayDates;
```

In this version of the function, I've used the `await` keyword before the `calendar.events.list` method to wait for the promise to resolve. This way TypeScript knows that the `holidays` variable is going to be an object with a `data` property that contains the `items` property and the function will directly return the `holidayDates` array.

Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.

#### You:
You cannot use await in a non-async function. Try to wrap an anonymous async function around the await.

#### ChatGPT:
You're correct, I apologize for my mistake.
The `await` keyword can only be used inside of an `async` function.
To fix this issue, you can wrap the entire function inside an anonymous `async` function and remove the `await` keyword.

Here is the updated version of the function:

```typescript

const getHolidayDates = (async function(year: number, holidayName: string): Promise<Date[]>{

    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
    }
});

export default getHolidayDates;
```

In this version of the function, I've wrapped the entire function inside an anonymous async function. This way the function will return a promise that resolves to an array of `Date` objects. And you can use the await keyword inside the function.
Please let me know if this version of the function works for you or if you have any other issues.

#### You:
The code of the answer for my question `The compiler says "'err' is of type 'unknown'.ts(18046)".` works best. But executing it returns with a "Bad Request" error message. So what can I log out to get more context of the error?

#### ChatGPT:
If the API returns a "Bad Request" error message, it means that the request you're making to the API is not well-formed or the API is not able to understand it.
In order to get more context on the error, you can try logging out the request options you're passing to the `calendar.events.list` method.
You can also log out the entire error object you're catching to see if it contains any additional information that might help you understand what's causing the error.

Here is an example of how you could modify the `catch` block to log out the request options and the error object:

```typescript
} catch (err) {
    console.log('request options:', JSON.stringify({
        calendarId: 'de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com',
        timeMin: format(new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
        timeMax: format(new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`), "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"),
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: 'startTime',
    }, null, 2));
    console.error('Error retrieving holiday dates:', err);
    throw new Error(`Error retrieving holiday dates: ${err.message}`);
}
```

#### You:
The console output is as follows `request options: {
  "calendarId": "de.german#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com",
  "timeMin": "2023-01-01167253120000001:00:00.000+01:00",

#### ChatGPT:
It looks like the request options are not formatted as expected.
The timeMin and timeMax options are not formatted correctly.
It should be in the format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ"
For example: `2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`

I apologize for the confusion, you can change the format of the timeMin and timeMax options like this:

```typescript
timeMin: format(new Date(`${year}-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`), "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx"),
timeMax: format(new Date(`${year}-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`), "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx"),
```

Please let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further assistance.

#### You:
Now the console output is different: `request options: {

Error retrieving holiday dates: Error: Holiday Himmelfahrt not found for year 2023
    at /Users/neubauer/Workspaces/chatgpt-schedule/src/util/holiday.ts:44:19
    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)`

#### ChatGPT:
It looks like the problem is that the function is not finding any events for the holiday you're searching for.
The error message `Holiday Himmelfahrt not found for year 2023` indicates that the function is unable to find any events with the summary "Himmelfahrt" in the year 2023.

There could be a few reasons for this:

- The holiday name is not spelled correctly in German
- The event for that holiday might not be present in the Google Calendar
- There could be an issue with the calendarId being used, make sure that it is correct
- The timeMin and timeMax options might be set to a range that does not include the date of the holiday

I would recommend checking the spelling of the holiday, double-checking the calendarId and also checking the range of the timeMin and timeMax options to make sure they include the date of the holiday.
Please let me know if you need further assistance.
