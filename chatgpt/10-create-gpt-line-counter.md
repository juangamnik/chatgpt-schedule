#### You:
You are a Linux and bash-script master and my personal assistant. If you understand, answer with READ.

#### ChatGPT:
READ.

#### You:
Write me a bash script, which reads in the file given as first parameter (expect it to be a markdown file) line by line. Each line should be checked whether it starts with "#### You:", then sum up the following lines (each line +1 starting from 0) in variable "you". Each line should be checked whether it starts with "#### ChatGPT:", then sum up the following lines (each line +1 starting from 0) in variable "chatgpt". After reading the complete file line by line, output the two sums in the variables "you" and "chatgpt" in the following format `You: $you, ChatGPT: $chatgpt".

#### ChatGPT:
Here's a bash script that should accomplish what you're looking for:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

you=0
chatgpt=0
line_num=0

# check if file was provided as first argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a file as the first argument"
  exit 1
fi

# check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "File not found"
  exit 1
fi

while read -r line
do
  if [[ $line == "#### You:"* ]]; then
    # sum up following lines
    while read -r you_line
    do
      if [[ $you_line == "####"* ]]; then
        break
      fi
      ((you++))
    done
  fi

  if [[ $line == "#### ChatGPT:"* ]]; then
    # sum up following lines
    while read -r chatgpt_line
    do
      if [[ $chatgpt_line == "####"* ]]; then
        break
      fi
      ((chatgpt++))
    done
  fi

  ((line_num++))

done < "$1"

echo "You: $you, ChatGPT: $chatgpt"
```

Here's how the script works:

1. First, it checks if a file was provided as the first argument. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
2. It then checks if the file exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
3. The script reads the file line by line using a while loop and the read command.
4. For each line, it checks if it starts with "#### You:". If it does, it enters another loop to sum up the following lines until it reaches a line that starts with "####". It does the same for lines starting with "#### ChatGPT:".
5. The ((line_num++)) statement keeps track of the current line number, so that the script knows when to stop summing up lines.
6. Finally, the script outputs the sums in the desired format.

You can save this script in a file, say `sum_lines.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x sum_lines.sh`, and run it with the markdown file as the first argument like this: `./sum_lines.sh input_file.md`.

#### You:
The code uses nested while loops to read the lines. It should be sufficient to have just one loop reading in the lines and change the count modes between summing up on variable "you" or "chatgpt". Please adapt the code.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here's the updated script that uses only one loop to read the lines and switches the count mode based on whether the current line starts with "#### You:" or "#### ChatGPT:":

```bash
#!/bin/bash

you=0
chatgpt=0
line_num=0
count_mode=""

# check if file was provided as first argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a file as the first argument"
  exit 1
fi

# check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "File not found"
  exit 1
fi

while read -r line
do
  if [[ $line == "#### You:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "you" lines
    count_mode="you"
    continue
  elif [[ $line == "#### ChatGPT:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "chatgpt" lines
    count_mode="chatgpt"
    continue
  elif [[ $line == "####"* ]]; then
    # switch off counting mode
    count_mode=""
  fi

  if [[ $count_mode == "you" ]]; then
    ((you++))
  elif [[ $count_mode == "chatgpt" ]]; then
    ((chatgpt++))
  fi

  ((line_num++))

done < "$1"

echo "You: $you, ChatGPT: $chatgpt"
```

Here's how the updated script works:

1. It starts by checking if a file was provided as the first argument and if it exists, just like before.
2. It then reads the file line by line using a while loop and the read command.
3. For each line, it checks if it starts with "#### You:" or "#### ChatGPT:". If it does, it sets the count mode accordingly and continues to the next line.
4. If the line starts with "####", it switches off the count mode.
5. If the count mode is set to "you" or "chatgpt", it increments the corresponding variable by 1 for each line.
6. Finally, the script outputs the sums in the desired format.

You can save this updated script in a file, say `sum_lines_v2.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x sum_lines_v2.sh`, and run it with the markdown file as the first argument like this: `./sum_lines_v2.sh input_file.md`.

#### You:
Please adapt the code so that you have another variable called "prompts", which is summed up once each time the `count_mode` "you" is activated.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's the updated script that adds the "prompts" variable and increments it each time the `count_mode` "you" is activated:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

you=0
chatgpt=0
prompts=0
line_num=0
count_mode=""

# check if file was provided as first argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a file as the first argument"
  exit 1
fi

# check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "File not found"
  exit 1
fi

while read -r line
do
  if [[ $line == "#### You:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "you" lines and increment prompts
    count_mode="you"
    ((prompts++))
    continue
  elif [[ $line == "#### ChatGPT:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "chatgpt" lines
    count_mode="chatgpt"
    continue
  elif [[ $line == "####"* ]]; then
    # switch off counting mode
    count_mode=""
  fi

  if [[ $count_mode == "you" ]]; then
    ((you++))
  elif [[ $count_mode == "chatgpt" ]]; then
    ((chatgpt++))
  fi

  ((line_num++))

done < "$1"

echo "You: $you, ChatGPT: $chatgpt, Prompts: $prompts"
```

Here's what changed:

1. We added a new variable called prompts and initialized it to 0 at the beginning.
2. When the count_mode is switched to "you", we increment the prompts variable by 1.
3. Finally, we include the prompts variable in the output.

You can save this updated script in a file, say `sum_lines_v3.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x sum_lines_v3.sh`, and run it with the markdown file as the first argument like this: `./sum_lines_v3.sh input_file.md`.

#### You:
Great. Please remove the case where variable "count_mode" is set to empty string. It is unnecessary.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's the updated code that removes the case where the `count_mode` variable is set to an empty string:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

you=0
chatgpt=0
prompts=0
line_num=0
count_mode=""

# check if file was provided as first argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a file as the first argument"
  exit 1
fi

# check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "File not found"
  exit 1
fi

while read -r line
do
  if [[ $line == "#### You:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "you" lines and increment prompts
    count_mode="you"
    ((prompts++))
    continue
  elif [[ $line == "#### ChatGPT:"* ]]; then
    # switch to counting "chatgpt" lines
    count_mode="chatgpt"
    continue
  fi

  if [[ $count_mode == "you" ]]; then
    ((you++))
  elif [[ $count_mode == "chatgpt" ]]; then
    ((chatgpt++))
  fi

  ((line_num++))

done < "$1"

echo "You: $you, ChatGPT: $chatgpt, Prompts: $prompts"
```

Here's what changed:

1. We removed the case where the count_mode variable is set to an empty string because it is unnecessary.
2. Everything else works the same as before.

You can save this updated script in a file, say `sum_lines_v4.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x sum_lines_v4.sh`, and run it with the markdown file as the first argument like this: `./sum_lines_v4.sh input_file.md`.
