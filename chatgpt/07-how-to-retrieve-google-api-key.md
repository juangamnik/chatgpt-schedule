#### You:
How can I retrieve an api key for accessing for example free holiday calendars.

#### ChatGPT:
In order to retrieve an API key for accessing a holiday calendar, you will
typically need to sign up for an account with the provider of the calendar. Once
you have an account, you should be able to find information on how to generate
an API key. This process can vary depending on the provider, so it's best to
check their documentation or support resources for specific instructions. Some
providers may also require you to agree to their terms of service or pay for
access to their API.

#### You:
the provider is google and I have already an account. So what do I need to do?

#### ChatGPT:
If the provider is Google and you already have an account, you can follow these
steps to retrieve an API key for the Google Calendar API:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select a project or create a new one by clicking the "New Project" button.
3. Once you've created or selected a project, navigate to the "Enable APIs and
   Services" page.
4. Search for and enable the "Google Calendar API"
5. Go to "Credentials" in the sidebar
6. Click on "Create Credentials" and select "API Key"
7. A new API key will be generated for you, which you can then use to access the
   Google Calendar API.

Please note that you may be prompted to configure the usage of the key, such as
adding a restriction. Also, If you need to access a specific calendar and not
only the calendar events, you will need to share the calendar with the api key's
email.

#### You:
The API key seems to be unconstrained, but it should work for the calendar API,
only. What should I do?

#### ChatGPT:
If the API key you generated is unconstrained and you want to use it
specifically for the Google Calendar API, you can add a restriction to the key.
This will ensure that the key can only be used for the Google Calendar API, and
cannot be used for any other Google APIs.

You can add a restriction to the key by following these steps:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select the project that the API key belongs to
3. Navigate to the "Credentials" page
4. Click on the name of the API key that you want to restrict
5. Scroll down to the "Key restriction" section
6. Select "HTTP referrers" as the restriction type
7. In the "Accept requests from these HTTP referrers" field, add the URLs that
   will be allowed to use the key.
8. Click on "Save" to apply the restriction.

You can also restrict the key to a specific IPs, or Application, depending on
the use case. Please note that, once you restrict the key, it will only work for
requests that come from the specified referrers or IPs.

If you need more detailed instructions or troubleshoot, you can check the Google
Cloud Console documentation.
