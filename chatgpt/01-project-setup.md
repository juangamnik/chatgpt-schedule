# Project Name

A simple TypeScript project that creates an iCal file from an input list of names and a year.

## Usage

To run the script, first make sure you have TypeScript installed. You can install it by running `npm install -g typescript`.

Then, clone or download the project, and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the following command to create the iCal file:

```css
ts-node index.ts --year 2022 --names "John Smith,Jane Doe" --filename "myEvents.ics"
```

The script takes in three command line arguments:

- year: the year for the events
- names: a comma-separated list of names for the events
- filename: the name of the iCal file to be created

## Example

Let's say you want to create an iCal file for events in 2022, with the names "John Smith" and "Jane Doe". The iCal file should be saved as "myEvents.ics".

You would run the following command:

```css
ts-node index.ts --year 2022 --names "John Smith,Jane Doe" --filename "myEvents.ics"
```

The script would then create the iCal file "myEvents.ics" with events for "John Smith" and "Jane Doe" in 2022.

## Code

```javascript
import { createNameDateMapping, createIcalFile } from './calendar'

const year = +process.argv[2]
const names = process.argv[4].split(',')
const filename = process.argv[6]

const events = createNameDateMapping(year, names)
createIcalFile(filename, events)
```

## Note

Make sure the "calendar.ts" is exist in the same directory with the above script.

## Function createNameDateMapping(year: number, names: string[]): { [name: string]: Date }

This function takes in a `year` and a list of `names` as inputs, and returns an object with the names as keys and `Date` as values.

## Function createIcalFile(filename: string, events: { [name: string]: Date })

This function takes in a `filename` and an `events` object as inputs, and creates an iCal file with the given events.

## Conclusion

This script is a simple example of how to use TypeScript to create an iCal file from command line inputs. It demonstrates how to use the `createNameDateMapping` and `createIcalFile` functions, as well as how to parse command line arguments in TypeScript. You can use this script as a starting point to create your own iCal files or to add more functionality.

#### You:
How can I initiate the project on the cli so that vscode can work with it and run and debug it

#### ChatGPT:
To set up your TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. In the terminal, run the command npm init to create a package.json file. This file will contain information about your project and its dependencies.
3. Install the TypeScript compiler by running npm install -D typescript. This will add TypeScript as a development dependency in your package.json file.
4. Create a tsconfig.json file in the root of your project folder. This file will contain the configuration options for the TypeScript compiler. You can use the command tsc --init to create a basic tsconfig.json file.
5. In the tsconfig.json file, set the "outDir" property to "./dist" to specify that the compiled JavaScript files should be placed in a "dist" folder.
6. Create a script in your package.json file to build the TypeScript files. You can add a script like this:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  },
```

1. Now you can build your project by running npm run build in the terminal.
2. To run your project, you can add a script in your package.json file to execute the compiled JavaScript file. For example, you can add a script like this:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  },
```

1. To run your project, you can use the command npm start in the terminal.
2. To debug your project in Visual Studio Code, you can add the following configuration in the launch.json file:

```bash
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js"
}
```

With these steps, you should now be able to build, run, and debug your TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code.

#### You:
is the launch.json complete as it is? If not, can you create me a working launch.json

#### ChatGPT:
The launch.json file that I provided in my previous response is a basic configuration that you can use to debug your TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. However, it may not be complete depending on your specific project requirements.

Here is an example of a complete launch.json file that you can use for debugging your TypeScript project:

```bash
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "sourceMap": true,
            "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"],
            "preLaunchTask": "build"
        }
    ]
}
```

This launch.json file includes the following properties:

- version: version of the launch configuration schema.
- configurations: an array of configurations that define how to launch your program.
- type: the type of configuration, in this case "node" for Node.js.
- request: the request type, in this case "launch" to start debugging.
- name: the display name of the configuration.
- program: the program to debug, in this case the compiled JavaScript file in the "dist" folder.
- cwd: the current working directory for the launched program, in this case the workspace folder.
- sourceMap: whether to enable source maps, set it to true.
- outFiles: the glob pattern for the output files, in this case all JavaScript files in the "dist" folder.
- preLaunchTask: the task to run before launching the program, in this case "build" to build the TypeScript files.

Please make sure that you have the correct path to the compiled javascript file.

You should also make sure that you have the tasks.json file configured correctly. You can use the following command to create it `Ctrl+Shift+B` or `Cmd+Shift+B` to create it.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "tsc",
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This tasks.json file includes the following properties:

- version: version of the tasks configuration schema.
- tasks: an array of tasks to run.
- label: the display name of the task, in this case "build".
- type: the type of task, in this case "shell" to run a shell command.
- command: the command to run, in this case "tsc" to build the TypeScript files.
- group: the group of the task, in this case "build" and set to be default.

With these configurations you should be able to debug your code and see the variables and the step by step execution of your code.

#### You:
What do I need to change to the abovementioned configurations if I want to put my typescript source files to the subfolder "src/" of my project?

#### ChatGPT:
If you want to put your TypeScript source files in a subfolder "src" of your project, you will need to update the following configurations in your tsconfig.json, launch.json and tasks.json files:

1. In the tsconfig.json file, update the "rootDir" property to "./src" to specify the root folder for the TypeScript files.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

1. In the launch.json file, update the "program" property to "${workspaceFolder}/dist/src/index.js" to specify the path to the compiled JavaScript file in the "dist/src" folder.

```bash
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/src/index.js"
}
```

1. In the tasks.json file, update the "outFiles" property to "${workspaceFolder}/dist/src/**/*.js" to specify the glob pattern for the output files.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "tsc",
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "args": [
                "--outDir",
                "dist/src"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

It is also a good practice to update the package.json script to reflect the new path to the compiled javascript file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/src/index.js"
  },
```

These changes will tell the TypeScript compiler to look in the "src" folder for the TypeScript files, and to place the compiled JavaScript files in the "dist/src" folder. The updated launch.json and tasks.json files will also point to the new location of the compiled JavaScript files. With these changes, your project should be able to build, run, and debug correctly with the TypeScript files in the "src" subfolder.

#### You:
Please adapt the code, so that it respects that function `createNameDateMapping` is `async`. You do not need to write the context with the readme around it. Just stick with the code, please.

#### ChatGPT:
Here is an example of how you can adapt the code to handle the `createNameDateMapping` function being asynchronous:

```javascript
import { createNameDateMapping, createIcalFile } from './calendar'

const year = +process.argv[2]
const names = process.argv[4].split(',')
const filename = process.argv[6]

createNameDateMapping(year, names)
    .then(events => createIcalFile(filename, events))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

In this example, I am calling the `createNameDateMapping` function and passing it the `year` and `names` inputs. Since this function is now asynchronous, it will return a promise. I am then chaining the `then` method on that promise, which will be called with the resolved value (`events`) once the promise is fulfilled. In the `then` callback, I am calling the `createIcalFile` function with the `filename` and `events` inputs. In the case where the promise is rejected, I am chaining the `catch` method on that promise which will be called with the rejection reason.

Please note that this example assumes that the `createNameDateMapping` and `createIcalFile` functions are correctly implemented to handle the async nature of the `createNameDateMapping` function.

#### You:
Please use async await instead of callbacks.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is an example of how you can use `async/await` to handle the `createNameDateMapping` function being asynchronous:

```javascript
import { createNameDateMapping, createIcalFile } from './calendar'

const year = +process.argv[2]
const names = process.argv[4].split(',')
const filename = process.argv[6]

async function main() {
    try {
        const events = await createNameDateMapping(year, names)
        createIcalFile(filename, events)
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
    }
}

main()
```

In this example, I am defining an `async` function `main`. Inside it, I am using the `await` keyword before calling the `createNameDateMapping` function, which will wait for the promise to be resolved before moving on to the next line of code. The resolved value will be stored in the `events` variable. Then I am calling the `createIcalFile` function with the `filename` and `events` inputs.
In case of an exception, it will be caught by the `catch` block and the error will be logged.

Please note that this example assumes that the `createNameDateMapping` and `createIcalFile` functions are correctly implemented to handle the async nature of the `createNameDateMapping` function.

#### You:
please adapt the `Readme.md` so that it does not contain any details regarding the code, but respects, that the script needs to be executed with a environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. For the example enter some placeholder api key value.

#### ChatGPT:
```vbnet
# Project Name

A simple TypeScript project that creates an iCal file from an input list of names and a year.

## Usage

To run the script, first make sure you have TypeScript installed. You can install it by running `npm install -g typescript`.

Then, clone or download the project, and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Before running the script, you need to set an environment variable called `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to a valid API key for the Google Calendar API. For example, you can set the environment variable by running this command:
```

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

```bash

Run the following command to create the iCal file:
```

ts-node index.ts --year 2022 --names "John Smith,Jane Doe" --filename "myEvents.ics"

```swift

The script takes in three command line arguments:
- `year`: the year for the events
- `names`: a comma-separated list of names for the events
- `filename`: the name of the iCal file to be created

## Example

Let's say you want to create an iCal file for events in 2022, with the names "John Smith" and "Jane Doe". The iCal file should be saved as "myEvents.ics".

You would first set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable by running this command:
```

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

```bash

Then, you would run the following command:
```

ts-node index.ts --year 2022 --names "John Smith,Jane Doe" --filename "myEvents.ics"

```vbnet

The script would then create the iCal file "myEvents.ics" with events for "John Smith" and "Jane Doe" in 2022.

Please make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with a valid API key for the Google Calendar API.

## Conclusion

This script is a simple example of how to use TypeScript to create an iCal file from command line inputs. It demonstrates how to use the `createNameDateMapping` and `createIcalFile` functions, as well as how to parse command line arguments in TypeScript. You can use this script as a starting point to create your own iCal files or to add more functionality.
```

Please note that this is just an example, you need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with a valid API key for the Google Calendar API and make sure that the key is properly set before running the script.

#### You:
In the code `const year = +process.argv[2]` leads to `NaN` although the second argument is set to `2023`.

#### ChatGPT:
You are correct that the code `const year = +process.argv[2]` would lead to `NaN` if the second argument is set to `2023` because `+process.argv[2]` is trying to cast the string value `"2023"` to a number using the unary plus operator.

To correctly handle the year argument, you can try to parse the year argument as an integer using `parseInt` function.

```javascript
const year = parseInt(process.argv[2])
```

This way, the `year` variable will be correctly set to the integer value 2023.

Additionally, you can also check the parsed year is a number or not by using `isNaN()` function.

```javascript
const year = parseInt(process.argv[2])
if (isNaN(year)) {
   console.log("Year must be a number")
   return
}
```

This will check if the parsed year is a number or not, if not it will print the error message and exit the script.

You may also want to add similar error handling for other arguments such as `names` and `filename`.

#### You:
That still das not work, but the problem seems to be, that the argument with index `2` is `--year` and not `2023`. Is there anything wrong in the code regarding the indices of the arguments and the example in the `readme.md`? can you adapt the code correspondingly? 

#### ChatGPT:
You are correct that the problem is that the argument at index 2 is `--year` and not the actual year value. The `process.argv` array contains command line arguments passed to the script, where the first element is the path to the node executable and the second element is the path to the script. The remaining elements are the arguments passed to the script, in this case `--year`, `2023`, `--names`, `"John Smith,Jane Doe"`, `--filename`, `"myEvents.ics"`.

To correctly handle the year argument, you can use a library such as `minimist` to parse the command line arguments and access them by their flag name.

```javascript
const argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
const year = argv.year;
```

This way, the `year` variable will be correctly set to the integer value 2023 by accessing the `year` property of the `argv` object.

You can also add error handling for missing arguments, like this:

```javascript
const argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
if (!argv.year) {
    console.log("Year is required")
    return
}
```

#### You:
can you use import syntax for mini mist instead and respect, that this is a top level function, so that `return` is not allowed and use an exit code `1` instead?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here's an example of how you can use the import syntax for `minimist` and handle the missing year argument:

```javascript
import minimist from 'minimist';

const argv = minimist(process.argv.slice(2));

if (!argv.year) {
    console.log("Year is required");
    process.exit(1);
}

const year = argv.year;
const names = argv.names.split(',');
const filename = argv.filename;
```

In this example, I am importing the `minimist` module and using it to parse the command line arguments. If the `year` argument is not present, the script will print an error message and exit the process with an exit code of 1 using the `process.exit()` function.

`process.exit` function is used to exit the process with a specific code, in this case `1` which indicates that an error occurred. The exit code `0` means that the process terminated without errors, which is the default behavior when a script finishes execution.

If the year argument is present, the script will continue and the year, names, and filename variables will be correctly set to the values passed in the command line.

The rest of the code stays the same. Please note that, the `minimist` function expects the values to be passed in the format `--key value` in the command line and not `--key=value`.
